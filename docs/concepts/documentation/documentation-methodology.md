# Documentation Methology (Diátaxis)

This projects documentation is an attempt to structure the most critical thoughts and processes of my homelab experience into a single space. The documentation methodology that I chose to _loosely_ follow is [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/), since I feel it can encapsulate everything needed in the most straight forward way. Diataxis is a more refined and detailed version forked off of the [Divio Documentation System](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/). Both Diataxis and Divio categorize documentation into four main sections:

- [Setup (tutorial)](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials): learning-oriented
- [Concepts (explanation)](https://diataxis.fr/explanation): understanding-oriented
- [How-to (how-to guides)](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides): goal-oriented
- [Reference (reference)](https://diataxis.fr/reference): information-oriented
