# Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a common source-code editor that can encapsulate most languages.
Since there is a large variety of VS Code extensions created by various users.
It makes sense to use their effort to your advantage. Many extensions have been
recommended to this repository through the `.vscode` directory at the base of
the repository.

## Extensions

There are many different extensions that have been included in this respository,
but they can each be broken off into separate categories. Not all of these
extensions are required, and some have alterative options that could be used
instead. However, these are my preferred extensions that I use daily.
