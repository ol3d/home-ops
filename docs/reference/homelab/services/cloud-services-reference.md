# Cloud Services

Not everything in a homelab _should_ nor _can_ be self-hosted. Along with the
free self-hosted services currently hosted on my homelab, I also utilize various
cloud services or need specific licencing to use certain products. Due to this,
here is a list of all of the free as well as paid cloud products/services that I
am currently using in my homelab. Additionally, there is a rough breakdown of
how much I pay per month with each of these services.
